"""Build `supplier_exposure_daily` — the per-supplier daily exposure rollup (WS-A).

Source: `ga4_dataform_reporting.monthly_profile_stats` — a (profile_id, date,
event_name) skeleton where the metric column **named after event_name** holds the
value (the `view_item` row populates `view_item`, the `view_item_list` row
populates `view_item_list`, etc.). We collapse the per-event rows into one
exposure row per (profile_id, date).

The aggregation runs **inside BigQuery** (the source is ~388M rows — never pulled
to pandas). Source and destination are both in the EU location, so it's a pure
server-side INSERT…SELECT.

Exposure is what drives retention (see docs/strategy/17). Category/segment and
Elastic rank are intentionally NOT joined here (different BQ region / source);
they're added downstream in the targeting step.

Lives in the EU `retention` dataset (co-located with the GA4 source so the
aggregation is a pure server-side INSERT…SELECT). Since the 2026-06-05 US→EU
migration the platform `retention` dataset is itself EU, so exposure and platform
tables now share one dataset (`dataset` == `dataset_eu` == `retention`).

COVERAGE CAVEAT: the source only populates the funnel metrics (view_item,
view_item_list, show_phone, select_item) from **2025-01 onward** — pre-2025 rows
exist but are null, so profile_views/impressions are 0 before 2025. Sufficient for
current/recent at-risk targeting; for a longer history, blend in raw
`ga4_dataform_output.view_item` (2023+) — see Spike 2 (YOO-229).
